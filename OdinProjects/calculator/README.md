This is the final project in the Foundations branch of the Odin Project. 
I have been given the use cases to build toward. I may also think of a few of my own use cases as I move forward.

Use cases:
- addition (function)
- subtraction (function)
- multiplication (function)
- division (function)
- can receive the input of an operator and 2 numbers and return the result of the operator function on those numbers (separate function)
- a UI with all possible numbers, the operators, an equals button, and a clear button. 
- each calculation should take place, one at a time, whenever the equals or another operator is pressed. 
- answers with long decimals should be rounded so that they do not overflow the screen.
- Pressing the equals button before entering two numbers or an operator should not evaluate; it should return an error.
- pressing 'clear' should wipe out any existing data.
- dividing by 0 should not evaluate; it should return an error.
- a decimal number should be possible; but users shouldn't be able to type more than one decimal point. 
- users should be able to backspace an input if they wish
- users should be able to input via either mouse (clicking) or keyboard
- while doing a series of calculations, the user should see the previous calculation
- the previous answer should be displayed on the screen
